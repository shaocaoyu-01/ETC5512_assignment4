## Data Details

#### Topic of this work

Since the reform and opening up, China's economic development has been
changing with each passing day,however, the imbalance of economic
development has always troubled China. This report will study the
relationship between the total economic volume and growth rate of each
province (autonomous region, municipality) since 1993, whether there is
a Matthew effect or an equilibrium situation. Furthermore, we will
explore whether there are different evolution laws in different regions
and different stages.

#### Data Description

The data is a panel data of nearly 34 years from 1990 to 2024, which
includes GDP, GDP per capita, growth rate of GDP per capita, that's because we
think to research the imbalance of development between provinces in China 
mainland and its trends, it's very helpful to conclude the relationship 
between the growth rate of GDP and its volumns.

And GDP has relationship with many variables, many scholars have researched 
about relationship between the growth rate and variables like industrial 
structure, growth rate of fixed asset of investment, urbanization rate, education 
level per capita, degree of opening up to the outside world, scientific and 
technological location.We use the above mentioned variables as control variables in 
this report.

According to Solar Jin(2025), the industrial structure has a significant 
relationship with the growth rate of GDP per capita. He use the ratio of the added 
value of the tertiary industry to the added value of the secondary industry
to measure the deep transformation of industrial structure. He defined it Industrial 
Upgrade Index.In this article, I will use this indicator as an indicator to measure 
our industrial structure

The fixed asset investment growth rate measures the annual percentage change 
in gross fixed capital formation, capturing how much new spending on long-lived 
physical assets. According to Wenyue Li, Jungang Li(2022), the growth rate of fixed 
asset of investment has significantly contributed to the growth of the GDP_per_capita.

The degree of opening up is an indicator referring to how extensively an economy 
engages with the global market through trade, investment, and regulatory integration. 
According to Huiguo Zhang(2017), they concluded that the degree of opening up has 
positive relationship with growth of GDP_per_capita. 

Urbanization rate means that the proportion of the residents who live in urban
areas rather than rural areas. It matters because the residents who live in the
urban areas usually created more GDP in average. 
According to Canjiang Song(2018), they found that the elasticity of urbanization
rate to per capita GDP growth is about 0.15.

The investment on education and the level of R&D funds usually indicate the indensity of human capital. 
More investment in Education , more indensity in human capital and the huamn 
capital is crucial to GDP, commonly speaking, well-educated guys create more GDP.
According to Danjiao Zhan(2021), she found the investment on education has 
contributed to the GDP growth and did a quantitative analysis.According to
Dandan Su, she researched the R&D funds have positive relationship 
with GDP Growth rate.

    (1993-2023):**
    
    - source: Chinese National Bureau of
      Statistics(<https://data.stats.gov.cn/adv.htm?cn=C01>)

    - restriction: It includes the GDP of all the provinces without
      the population so the GDP per capita is not straight forward.

### Why we take the data
In order to study whether the development of Chinese provinces is regional 
equilibrium or Matthew effect, we believe that it is crucial to capture the 
relationship between the GDP of each province and its GDP growth rate. 
However, after reading some literature, we found that there are many control 
variables that can affect the GDP growth rate, such as the growth rate of fixed
asset investment, urbanization level, education investment level, and degree 
of opening up to the outside world. So we collected these data from the entire
Internet to exclude their possible influence on our conclusions.

### Data source for it

1. Dataset 1,2,3,4,5,7,9 are all from the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics
   Dataset 6 are from the Ministry of Education
2.对于数据里面的一些变量做解释

### what the data tells us?

```{r}

## Behind the Scene

### What's in the section

#### Question 4

*Tell us about a part(s) of your data processing or analysis that
weren't "sexy" and wouldn't typically be included in a blog post. (e.g.
Was their any data drudgery or time intensive wrangling? Were there any
repetitive tasks or manual tasks? If it was easy, describe what made it
easy?)*

#### Question 5

*Were there any challenges that you faced in conducting this analysis.
These may take the form of data limitations or coding challenges? (e.g.
Was there anything in your analysis that you were not anticipating when
you started? Did you have to change your intended scope?)*

#### Question 6

*Tell us about any imperfect parts of your work or how would like to
expand this analysis in future? (We don't expect you to solve everything
in one assignment.)*

#### Question 7

*An additional 2 marks will be awarded for the code you used to produce
your analysis and report. These marks include reproducibility, compiling
of your .html, production of any figures and tables etc.*
